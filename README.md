# livepeer-grant-enterprise-scale-orchestrator
The Grant Proposal Idea: Building Livepeer.org Decentralized Video Mining (Orchestrator/Transcoder) infrastructure at scale.

**Give a 3 sentence description about this proposal.**

The Livepeer Orchestrator / Transcoder production deployment and management is complex due to many moving parts. As an Multi-Node Orchestrator operator, I've encountered many pitfalls and complications that resulted in production outages. I'd like to provide intermediate-level documentation and video series that walks new and existing orchestrators through a Livepeer install that can pleasant to work with and maintain in production. 

**Describe the problem you are solving.** 

Most of the Livepeer Orchestrator/Transcoder documenation is based on very trivial single-node deployments. They focus on manual steps that do not require a node operator to really plan out what a production deployment should look like at scale. 

**Describe the solution you are proposing.** 

**Describe the scope of the project including a rough timeline and milestones** 

**Please estimate hours spent on project based on the above**
